            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Vpon the ſame day in the afternoone, there was a Tragedy played, wherein was ſhewed, the manner of the Turkes fight againſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. At which time, the Spayniſh Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour that laſt departed <hi>England,</hi> came with a great traine into the Citty from <hi>Bruixills,</hi> and there was very honorably receiued as well by the Cittizens there, as alſo by all the Captaines and Souldiers, and great triumphing was at his comming in, amongſt which, the Cittizens cauſed great ſtore of ſhips to be placed before the towne. and there they planted a great number of ſouldiers, which with their long ſhooting and diſcharging their pieces &amp; Ordinance they beate
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16335:5"/>
downe a huge great Ball of Braſſe or Copper, which was richly guilded ouer, which ſtood vpon the top of the ſteeple of S. Michaells Church, and ſhot the ſame quite through in many places: the chardge of making of a new Ball, and place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it there againe as the other was before, will coſt them an infinit ſome of money: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer at the time great ſtore of fireworkes were ſhowne and made vpon the waters, to the great delight of the Embaſſadour and all others that were there preſent.</p>
            <p>The next day after, they likewiſe acted a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie in Spayniſh, the effect and meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, was (altogether) to ſhew, and make the people to beleeue that they are, &amp; ſo they account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be, both lords and maiſters ouer the whole world. But let all true Chriſtians now marke well what afterwardes inſued amongſt them.</p>
            <p>The third day after <hi>S. Iames</hi> his day and feaſt holden amongſt them as afore rehearſed, in the afternone, how the deuill came &amp; playd his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy there in the ſame Church and Cloyſter of Saint Michaells, who came thither with ſuch a horrible and terrible noyſe both of Thunder and lightning, that all the people that were in the towne were greatly amazed thereat.</p>
            <p>Aſſoone as this Sathanicall Fiend came into the Cittie in this fierce and terrible manner, making a great noyſe or roaring ouer the ſame, he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16335:5"/>
firſt came &amp; ſate vpon the croſſe which ſtandeth vpon the toppe of the Steeple of S. Michaells Church where he was diſcerned &amp; plainely ſeene of many people, hauing in one of his vgly and filthy Clawes, a huge great ſtone, the which ſtone with great and mighty force, he caſt downe into the ſaid ſteeple, and therewith he made ſuch a huge and fearefull a noyſe and ratling, that the Munckes that were in the Cloyſter, with great feare and anguiſh ran all out of their lodgings, verily ſuppoſing that the deuill had bin at their heeles: from thence he went into the Steeple, (as it ſeemed vnto them all) and ſet the ſame on fire, wherewith it burnt moſt fearefully, and the flame thereof was ſo terrible and great, that many of the ſtones of the Steeple (with the heate and force of the fire) flew out and ſcattered ſo abroad, that it did exceeding much hurt, in and about the ſame Church and Cloyſter, and likewiſe the leade being molten, dropt downe ſo extreame faſt and was ſo ſcalding hot, that no man durſt goe neere to quench that vnmercyfull fire, the fury of it was ſo great: neuertheles the Munckes be ſtird them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo wel and luſtely there, to quench the ſame fire with holy-water, that they had ſpent ſo much thereof, that they had worke inough to doe, to read their ordinary Coniuration, and to make their Autentible Charme, to conſecrate more holy-water: And yet all that they could doe at that time would not ſerue their turne, for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16335:6"/>
at that inſtant, if that the common ſort of People (as labouring men and ſuch like) had not come thither to ayde and aſſiſt them, in this their great neceſſitie and ſtill called for both holyed and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holyed water, and had more ſteadfaſter faith and better and more perſeuerance in them, then the Munckes and themſelues, I veriely perſwade my ſelfe, that their holy water would haue little auayled them at that time. But if they had not mixed other vn-holy water therewith, and by the carefulnes of the chiefe Gouernoures and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and of the good induſtrie of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, ſouldiers and labouring men that were then preſent, all of them being moſt carefull and painefull in this buſines, and ready to doe their beſt indeuours in this extremitie, who (by Gods helpe and theirs) at laſt quenched the Fier by force, and yet before they could doe it, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the leades that couered the Church was molten downe from the top thereof, &amp; many ſtones flew out of the walles &amp; did great harme, both to the lodgings in the Cloyſter, and to many people inhabiting there about, beſides the great hurt that was done to the Church, at that time. The like villanie wrought againſt Gods Church by the moſt wicked Feend, hath neuer, or ſeldome heretofore bin heard of.</p>
            <p>But when Sathan had performed this wicked Tragedy, before ſpoken of: yet he began a new, to ſkew the Munckes what he was further able
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16335:6"/>
to doe, he began to play a Commedy with a great Picture that was hang'de within the Church, that had bin made by one of the rareſt or excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt workeman in the whole Countreys, whoſe name was (as then called) <hi>Peter Rubbens,</hi> a man well knowne throughout all the ſeuenteene Prouinces for his knowledge and ſkill in that Art or ſcience, and that there is none comparable vnto him, which ſaid Picture, the deuill rent and tore all in many pieces, he ruinated the ſame in ſuch manner and ſort, that the repayring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will coſt an hundred pound (at the leaſt) before it can be wrought to that perfection which it was of and ſo ſet vp againe, in the like order and forme as it was at the firſt there placed.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, he in his Sathanicall courſe, rent and ſpoyled the Alter whereupon this picture or Idolatrous Immage ſtood vpon, alſo ſpoyled &amp; defaced the ſame w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his wicked nayles or clawes, that he almoſt tore the ſame all quite downe to the ground, which ſince that time, hath bin view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſeene by many thouſandes of people, who doe greatly admire at the ſame, they all gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God moſt harty thankes for their ſafe deliuerance from all the miſchiefes that Sathan (if he might haue by Gods ſufferance) bin as then permitted to haue done his owne will.</p>
            <p>Moreouer he tooke the Immage of an other Saint which he papiſticall ſort of perſons much honored there, and made great account thereof,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16335:7"/>
for that they held the ſame for a great Relicke in their Church, and did much more worſhip and honour that Relicke then all the reſt.</p>
            <p>But what was it that grieued the Papiſts there, and in many other places planted moſt? that was, for the diſtruction and ſpoyling of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Immage (of what nature, quallitie or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſame was of, none or very few can tel) yet notwithſtanding, amongſt many of them, great accompt was made thereof, but to what vſe, let vs leaue them to their owne conceipts and fond opinion, and now let vs returne to a third action.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe he tooke an other Immage of a ſaint (pictured like an old Frier in times paſt) that was neere the place where the other ſtood, and caſt both it, the ſtone and place whereon it was ſeated all vnto the ground, and withall (not yet contented) with this, beare it as ſmall as powder.</p>
            <p>All which his Sathanicall actiuitie was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon the third day after <hi>S. Iaques</hi> his day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned: all which by him was performed in the Cloyſter of Saint Michaells, and vpon the ſudden the deuill was gon away againe none perceiued him, and then his playes and ſhewes were ended.</p>
